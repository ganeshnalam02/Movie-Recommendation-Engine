# Movie Recommendation Engine

This repository contains the code and resources for building a Movie Recommendation Engine using the IMDb dataset. The engine is designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history, utilizing various recommendation algorithms.

## Project Overview

The Movie Recommendation Engine is built to provide personalized movie suggestions to users. It leverages the IMDb dataset to extract movie, ratings, and user preferences information. The engine supports various recommendation techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods.

## Dataset

The project uses the IMDb dataset, which includes information about movies, ratings, genres, directors, actors, and more. The dataset can be downloaded from the [IMDb website](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) or accessed through other data sources.

- **Movies:** Metadata about movies, including titles, genres, release dates, etc.
- **Ratings:** User ratings for different movies.
- **Users:** Information about users, including their rating history.


## Features

- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests movies similar to those a user has previously liked.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies with similar content to the ones a user has rated highly.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines different recommendation methods to improve accuracy.

## Modeling Techniques

The project employs various machine-learning algorithms and techniques:

- **Collaborative Filtering:** Matrix Factorization, K-Nearest Neighbors
- **Content-Based Filtering:** TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity
- **Hybrid Models:** Combination of collaborative and content-based methods
